  cat <<END

The launcher has been removed, but the files and games it installed are still there. If you want to remove the launcher completely, have a look at the directories used by the launcher and remove them :
- \$HOME/.config/Ankama
- \$HOME/.config/Ankama\\ Launcher
- \$HOME/.config/zaap
- \$HOME/.config/unity3d/Ankama/
- \$HOME/.config/Dofus\\ Retro

END
}
