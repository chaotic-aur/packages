To complete the installation of userchromeJS, you need to copy the directory:

  /usr/share/firefox-userchromejs/base/chrome

into your firefox profile directory, which should be located at:

  ~/.mozilla/firefox/<some-chars>.<profile-name>

(including the 'chrome' directory itself), and then open about:support and
click "Clear startup cache..." and restart firefox.
Then you can copy additional .uc.js and .as.css files to be loaded into the
'chrome' folder, and install legacy extensions via the Add-ons Manager inside
firefox. Some additional scripts and addons are available in

  /usr/share/firefox-userchromejs/misc

Some other scripts can be found in (archived, but still maintained):
