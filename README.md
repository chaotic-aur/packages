#### Some packages we have already built

- [Linux-tkg kernels](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg) (BMQ, CFS,LTO, PDS, TT + their generic_v3 variations)
- Other popular kernel variations such as [Mainline](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-mainline)/, [Xanmod-{tt,rt,lts}](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&SeB=nd&K=xanmod), [Vfio](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-vfio)/-[lts](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-vfio-lts), [Next-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-next-git), [Cachyos-BORE](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-cachyos-bore) or [TT](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-tt)
- A quite complete [KDE stack](https://invent.kde.org/explore/groups?sort=name_asc) in a [separate repo](https://forum.garudalinux.org/t/kde-6-repository-testing/31442). 
- Most of the existing emulators & gaming utilities like [Yuzu](https://yuzu-emu.org/), [RPCS3](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3), and {[Proton](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom),[Wine](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom)}-GE-Custom
- A lot of browsers like [Firedragon](https://github.com/dr460nf1r3/firedragon-browser), [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium), [Firefox-wayland-hg](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firefox-wayland-hg), , and [Icecat](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/)
- ... a lot more. Check out the [package lists](https://github.com/chaotic-aur/packages/find/main) to find out what exactly gets built and when! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### Modified packages

While we would prefer to build AUR packages without modification, this is often not practical or possible.

- Common errors and poor packaging practices are automatically corrected.
    + Missing commands, or other adjustments, are added to allow the package to build successfully.
    + Erroneous commands that could result in disruptive behaviors are removed.
    + Automatic corrections are not marked because they usually do not alter package functionality.
- Some packages are manually adjusted (interfere).
    + Issues that the automatic corrections don't cover are corrected.
    + Interfered packages are marked by an optional depends on `chaotic-interfere`.
        -  `chaotic-interfere` is a dummy package that is *not* intended to be installed.  Installing it does no good or harm.
- Some packages have been replaced by custom packages, usually a fork of the original.
    + The original usually had some issue that was difficult to solve by other means.
    + Fork vs interfere is decided case-by-case.
        - Interfere capability may have been limited at the time of the fork.
        - Some custom packages may be moved to the interfere system, or vice versa.
    + Custom packages are *not* currently marked.

Chaotic-AUR contains a metapackage, `chaotic-kf5-dummy`.  This is a *temporary* workaround to allow some packages to continue functioning while upstream renames the KF5 packages.  Eventually the dummy package, and any related packages that are not updated, will be dropped.  This is planned for when KF6 becomes the upstream default.

#### Banished and rejected packages üìë

This is a list of packages that we will reject for good reasons:

- **snapd**: We didn't know how to help our users with it since it breaks *A LOT*. We recommend using native packages or [FlatPak](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Flatpak) instead. Also, [there are a lot of other reasons to not use Snaps](https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/ppyz0g/damn_you_ubuntu/hd7jg1p/).

- **lib32-\***: The difficulty of maintaining 32-bit packages is increasing as their usefulness decreases.  They may be considered to keep existing packages working, like `wine-*`.  Otherwise, use 64-bit packages when available.

- **gst-plugins-{ugly,bad}**: These need too frequent rebuilds which can't be dealt with as we don't control the packages pkgrel. Ultimately this would result in a bad user experience - dependency requests however are welcome!

- **ffmpeg-{full,headless}**:  These need too frequent rebuilds which can't be dealt with as we don't control the packages pkgrel. Ultimately this would result in a bad user experience - dependency requests however are welcome!

- **mpv-amd, ffmpeg-amd**: This is just MPV/FFMPEG without CUDA and NVENC to achieve shorter build times without actual end-user benefit.

- **unreal-engine (and -git)**: Some mirrors don't have sufficient storage space.

- **python2**: Has been EOL for a couple of years, and was [removed from Arch repositories](https://archlinux.org/news/removing-python2-from-the-repositories/). Requests for packages that depend on it in any way will be rejected (see [#1958](https://github.com/chaotic-aur/packages/issues/1958)).

- **linux-ck**: Two reasons, first our `linux-tkg-*` already includes those bits of optimizations, second there is [repo-ck](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unofficial_user_repositories#repo-ck) with official pre-built binaries for it.

- Dependencies without any dependents: Such packages are useless by themselves.  Maintaining them wastes effort that is better spent elsewhere.

#### Banned due to licensing issues üõë

- **aseprite{-git}**: Redistribution is explicitly prohibited in its [FAQ](https://www.aseprite.org/faq/#can-i-redistribute-aseprite).

- **multimc-git**: Redistribution of custom binaries that include their API keys and trademarked assets is [explicitly prohibited](https://multimc.org/#Branding).

- **tlauncher**: Legal gray area, as it potentially allows playing Minecraft in a reduced capacity without license.

- **feishu**: Unauthorized redistribution of their applications is explicitly prohibited per [ToS](https://www.feishu.cn/en/terms).

- **rider**: Redistribution disallowed per [ToS](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/toolbox/user).
