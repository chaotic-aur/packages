#### Banished and rejected packages üìë

This is a list of packages that we will reject for good reasons:

- **snapd**: I didn't know how to help my users with it since it breaks *A LOT*. I recommend using native packages or [FlatPak](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Flatpak) instead. Also, [there are a lot of other reasons to not use Snaps](https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/ppyz0g/damn_you_ubuntu/hd7jg1p/).

- **lib32-x265**:	There is absolutely no use case in which a 32-bit application (Linux or Windows) would want to ENCODE HEVC. I recommend disabling x265 for the packages depending on it (usually `FFmpeg` or `GStreamer`).

- **gst-plugins-{ugly,bad} (and lib32)**: These need too frequent rebuilds which can't be dealt with as we don't control the packages pkgrel. Ultimately this would result in a bad user experience - dependency requests however are welcome!

- **ffmpeg-{full,headless} (and lib32)**:  These need too frequent rebuilds which can't be dealt with as we don't control the packages pkgrel. Ultimately this would result in a bad user experience - dependency requests however are welcome!

- **mpv-amd, ffmpeg-amd**: This is just MPV/FFMPEG without CUDA and NVENC to achieve shorter build times without actual end-user benefit.

- **unreal-engine (and -git)**: Some mirrors don't have sufficient storage space.

- **python2**: Has been end of life for a couple years, and was [removed from Arch repositories](https://archlinux.org/news/removing-python2-from-the-repositories/). Requests for packages that depend on it in any way will be rejected (see [#1958](https://github.com/chaotic-aur/packages/issues/1958)).



#### Banned due to licensing issues üõë

- **aseprite{-git}**: Redistribution is explicitly prohibited in its [FAQ](https://www.aseprite.org/faq/#can-i-redistribute-aseprite).

- **multimc-git**: This application is licensed under the Apache 2 license, which prohibits distributing [custom binaries](https://multimc.org/#Branding) like the one built by us.

- **polymc-cracked-git**: Even though the apps own license is GPL, it allows playing Minecraft without license. Therefore we are not adding it.

- **tlauncher**: Same as above, it allows playing Minecraft without license.

- **feishu**: Unauthorized redistribution of their applications are explicitly prohibited per [ToS](https://www.feishu.cn/en/terms).
