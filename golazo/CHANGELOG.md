### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.29.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
- **Team name derivation** - Fix bug causing mislabeling in WC team name derivation

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

### Changed
- **Caching** — FotMob league page bodies are now cached for 60s and shared across the live, stats, World Cup, and standings views, reducing redundant network calls during quick navigation.
- **Reddit goal-link retrieval** — goal replay links now load one-by-one in the match panel and recover gracefully when Reddit rate-limits the app, instead of all attempts failing in a burst.

### Fixed
- **Live matches view** — matches that kicked off before the user's UTC midnight (e.g. evening kickoffs for users in the Americas) are no longer dropped from the Live view.
- **Live detection at kickoff** — matches flip to live the moment FotMob's `halfs.firstHalfStarted` timestamp moves into the past (the actual kickoff time), even if FotMob's `started` flag still lags. Future timestamps remain not-started, so scheduled matches with a published kickoff time are no longer misclassified as live.
- **Right panel auto-load** — first match in the list auto-populates when the right panel is empty (live and finished views).
- **Live matches refresh (R)** — pressing `r` on the live list (with no match opened) now force-refreshes the live list by bypassing the league-page cache. Previously `r` was a no-op on the list itself.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **AFC Champions League Two** - Added the AFC Champions League Two (FotMob ID 9469) to the supported leagues list under the Asia region.

### Changed
- **Reddit goal-link retrieval** — improved coverage for World Cup and national-team matches, with looser team and scorer name matching across spellings, diacritics, and common r/soccer title formats.
- **UI Refinements** — minor visual tweaks improving focus indicators and overall consistency.

### Fixed

## [0.27.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed
- **World Cup Grid Alignment** - Reworked the World Cup grid to render consistently across terminals and cleared stale content when navigating between sub-views.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Agentic CLI Mode** - Golazo is now usable by agentic dev tools (Claude Code, Codex, etc). Adds JSON subcommands (`live`, `finished`, `match`, `leagues`, `capabilities`) with a stable envelope, typed error codes and self-describing contract. TUI behavior is unchanged. See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

### Changed

### Fixed
- **World Cup Flags** - Fixed ambiguous FotMob short codes (e.g. South Africa/South Korea both `SOU`) and missing 2026 qualifier flags causing teams to render with the wrong code or no flag.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **World Cup View** - New top-level view for the FIFA World Cup with a group-grid overview as the default sub-view, scrollable groups list (`t`), per-group detail, knockout bracket (`b`), and upcoming matches for the next 4 days (`u`). Flag emojis prefix team names across the grid, group detail, and upcoming views.

### Changed

### Fixed
- **World Cup Team Labels** - All World Cup views now render teams as `<flag> <3-letter code>` (e.g. `🇦🇷 ARG`), with a local name-to-code map for teams missing a `shortName` from FotMob.
- **Update Noop** - `golazo --update` now skips the Homebrew/install-script call when the running binary is already on the latest GitHub release (or is a dev build), printing an informative message instead of reinstalling. Network failures while checking the latest version still fall through to today's install behavior.
- **Debug Log Hint** - The `--debug` banner and `--debug` flag help now display the platform-correct log path (`~/.config/golazo/golazo_debug.log` on Linux per XDG, `~/.golazo/golazo_debug.log` on macOS/Windows) instead of a hardcoded macOS path.
- **World Cup Hints** - Removed a redundant tab hint above the groups list so each sub-view shows a single, accurate help line.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- **Aggregate Score** - Finished knockout matches (Champions League, Europa League, etc.) now display the aggregate score and eliminated team below the match score in the details panel

### Changed

### Fixed
- **Homebrew Update** - Fixed `golazo -u` falling back to the install script when brew successfully built the new version but failed the link step due to a conflicting binary
- **Link Rendering** - Fixed highlight and goal replay links not being clickable in macOS Terminal.app and other terminals that don't support OSC 8; links now render as visible bracketed URLs that Terminal.app detects natively on right-click

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Live Statistics & Standings** - Press `x` for match statistics (possession, shots, etc.) or `s` for league standings while viewing any live match

### Changed

### Fixed
- **High CPU usage** - Fixed continuously growing CPU after repeated live match refreshes caused by duplicate poll and render tick chains

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Error Visibility** - API errors are now surfaced to the user with a retry hint instead of showing silent empty states

### Changed
- **Performance** - Reduced API overhead with connection pooling, goroutine limiting, pre-compiled regexes, memoized name normalization, and slice/map pre-allocation
- **Internal Code Quality** - Extracted shared rate limiter and generic TTL cache packages, consolidated duplicated UI helpers, and replaced file-based debug logging with `log/slog`
- **Concurrency** - In-flight API requests are now cancelled when navigating away from a view, preventing wasted work
- **Test Coverage** - Added unit tests for fotmob client/types, reddit matcher, data settings, rate limiter, and cache packages

### Fixed
- **Silent Error Swallowing** - Settings save, notification, and Reddit client init errors are now logged instead of discarded
- **Live Score Sync** - Fixed left panel score falling out of sync with the right panel between 5-minute list refreshes
- **Match Details Broken** - Fixed match data returning empty after FotMob removed their JSON API endpoints
- **Live View Upcoming Matches** - Fixed upcoming matches not showing unless stats view was visited first

## [0.22.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Ligue 2** - Added support for French Ligue 2 (Thanks @hkajdan!)
- **Add more German leagues** - Added support for German 2. Bundesliga and 3. Liga (Thanks @lukasgierth!)

- **Substitutions in Finished View** - Finished match details now show a "Substitutions" section (after Goals and Cards) with the same styling as the live view (player in/out, minute)

### Changed
- **Substitution Rendering** - Live and finished views now share a single substitution content builder (`buildSubstitutionContent`) so behaviour and styling stay consistent

### Fixed
- **Half-Time Score** - Fixed HT score being overwritten with the final score when a match finishes
- **Match Details & Scores** - Fixed match details returning nil and scores showing as empty due to FotMob API changes

## [0.21.0] - 2026-02-07
