<h2>Purpose of Rename My TV Series</h2>
<p>Originally the application was built as a purpose to learn more about <a title="Lazarus Pascal - Free, Delphi 7 like, developers environment" href="https://www.lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus Pascal</a> and cross-platform development.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the tool is being used be a lot of users to help them rename TV-Series files.<br />
Just keep in mind that this tool is not to promote illegal downloading or illegal sharing of copyrighted materials. It&#8217;s just a handy tool to occasionally rename some of your TV show files.</p>
<p>The philosophy is a simple work flow; you have a few odd named TV Show episodes and you&#8217;d like to give them a proper name, based on the TV Show name, season, episode and title of the episode. This has been expanded with features like resolution, year, data first aired, etc.</p>
<p>This tool by no means pretends to be anything else than just that.</p>
<p><em>Some features:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Support the new TheTVDB.com API (v2)</li>
<li>Caching shows and banners (so reloading at the later time could go faster)</li>
<li>Dark Theme support (MacOS and Linux only, accent color observed)</li>
<li>Automatically move files into a desired directory structure</li>
<li>Define your own file and directory name format</li>
<li>Create NFO files for the TV Show and for the individual Episodes</li>
<li>Store a banner for the TV Show</li>
<li>Merge 2 Episodes into 1 (filename only of course)</li>
<li>Detection of resolution, video format, Audio and Video codec, and audio channels</li>
<li>Log file of what files have been renamed</li>
</ul>
