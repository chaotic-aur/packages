# mesa-git userpatches

You can make use of your own patches that aren't available in mesa-git/community-patches by putting them in this folder before running makepkg.

They need to be diffs against the targeted tree.

**!! Patches with unrecognized extension will get ignored !!**

You can use your own mesa patches by giving them the .mymesapatch extension.

You can also revert mesa patches by giving them the .mymesarevert extension.
