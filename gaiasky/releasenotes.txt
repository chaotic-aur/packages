# Gaia Sky 3.6.10

This version brings lots of minor improvements and bug fixes.

## Features
- Localize Wikipedia API queries for object information.
- Add file-level cache to TLE subsystem. TLE files are also cached per-group to avoid unnecessary sequential calls to fetch the same file. By default, the TTL for TLE files is 1 hour.
- Directory structure of virtual texture tiles now accepts more formats (`levelx`, `levelxx`, `x`, `xx`).
- Set default virtual texture cache size to 10. Add information tooltip to cache size in preferences window.
- Add markers for towns and landmarks. Night lights go out with ambient light in PBR shader.
- Country perimeter lines disappear when the camera gets close to the surface of the Planet.
- Add new attributes to dataset definition format: `links` (now accepts multiple sources as links), `creator` (the creator or curator of the dataset), `credits` (specific attribute for credits instead of adding them to the description; multiple strings accepted).

## Bug Fixes
- Typo in default shader class (`u_emissionCubemap` -> `u_emissiveCubemap`) prevented emissive/night cubemaps from working.
- Add `nightCubemap` as alias to `emissiveCubemap` in material component.
- Add `specularValue` and `specularValues` as aliases to `specular` in material component, with floating point number parameters.
- Properly filtre directories when building the SVT quadtree structure to avoid incorrect 'Worng directory name format' warnings.
- Deactivating atmospheres causes night texture to apply uniformly to all planet as if it were a regular emissive texture.
- Procedural generation window does not fit in the window with the new UI theme. Fix layout by introducing scroll panes and resizing elements.
- Layout issue in right pane of dataset manager window prevented it from using scroll, causing the window to be too large in some cases.
- Layout issue and tooltip text in datasets component.
- Move `genVersionFile` task to the top of the dependency list (before `compileJava`) so that we always have the correct file available.
- Mend wording in new data pack notification window.
