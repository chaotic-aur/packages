# Gaia Sky 3.6.4

## Features
- improve on-screen keyboard in controller UI.
- add custom marker textures and custom colors for locations.
- add markers to locations; they pinpoint the exact position of the location labe.
- add new attribute to location marks, 'ignoreSolidAngleLimit', which disregards the limits when computing visibility. Cap angular sizes for all locations.
- add session type to system information (Linux only).
- remove 'cosmic locations' content type, move it to regular locations (requires default data pack update.).
- add location type attribute to location objects. This attribute is used to categorize locations by groups in the individual visibility window.
- separate scene from other elements (labels, lines, etc.) to be able to apply different post-processing effects to each.
- move console business logic to console manager entity.
- add an implementation of console/terminal, which accepts commands to interact directly with the Gaia Sky API.
- add a generic map in the base component to store 'unrecognized' attributes; these get displayed in the object info window.

## Bug Fixes
- prevent virtual objects (hooks, invisibles, catalogs, etc.) from appearing in the individual visibility window. Hide meta-components (atmospheres, keyframes, etc.) from buttons list. Fix layout.
- always load HIP numbers if present in the STIL data loader.
- update jetty, json and xmlrpc libraries to secure versions (the old versions contain known vulnerabilities).
- inform user of unsupported cubemap textured objects with procedural generation.

## Build System
- update versions of jcommander, STIL and ApFloat, remove Joise.
- update oshi library version.

## Documentation
- add architectures to download table.
- fix typos and spelling errors in changelog file.
- move VR info into README.md from VR.md.
