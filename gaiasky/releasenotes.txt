# Gaia Sky 3.7.0

## Features
- Gamepad mapping changes: map labels on/off to button X, unmap minimap, map A to camera speed-up (hold to make camera faster). RB and LB mapped to vertical movement (up/down) in free camera mode.
- Replace 'displays' section in about window with 'graphics cards'.
- Add infrastructure to be able to create and load ray-marching effects on-demand in the background. Make sure that ray-marching effects stay at their designated location by allowing addition of effects at a particular position in the post-processing chain.
- Enable IDs in particle groups. Trim down IDs in camera info pane from 14 to 12 characters.
- Improve 'no connection' dialog, with more information and hints as to whether the issue is with our server or with the local internet connection.
- Do not show blocking dialog if base data is present when we can't connect to the datasets server. Show a popup notification instead. In the dataset manager window, make installed datasets tab the default view in some cases.
- Add support for pulling cloud textures from online resources.
- Add calls to clear label regexp filtering. Improve documentation on some API calls.

## Bug Fixes
- Guard OS code name getter behind NPE check during Flatpak discovery. This fixes a crash at startup with macOS Tahoe.
- Remove UI window shadow, as it messes with the internal padding due to the 9-patch implementation in Libgdx.
- Gamepad focus order in welcome GUI. Decrease poll delay for gamepad axes.
- Misalignments in about window layout.
- `TLEParserTest` does not initialize settings, leading to NPE.
- Synchronize TLE initializer to prevent multiple creations/editions of TLE data and derived JSON files at the same time.
- Size issue in gamepad image in gamepad settings window. Increase maximum value of axis power slider to 15. Set value of vertical movement (RB/LB) to 1 instead of 0.1, to match other camera motion inputs.
- Reduce range of sensitivity and axis power sliders in gamepad config window.
- Connect `LABEL_CLEAR_FILTER_REGEX_CMD` event to scene observer. This fixes the `clearLabelFilterRegexps()` method.
- Increase maximum eye separation in stereo mode, fix star/particle label positioning in stereoscopic mode.

## Build System
- Update bundled JRE in install4j scripts to Java 25 (jdk-25+36).
- Remove `-XX:+ZGenerational` flag from run script, as support was removed in Java 24.
- Clean up gradle build file, and separate `dist` task into multiple sub-tasks to increase granularity and improve tracking in case of errors. Make it compatible with Gradle 9.1.x.
- Migrate from multi-string notation to single-string notation for dependencies to prepare for Gradle 10.
- Upgrade Jackson version to 2.20.0.
- Upgrade OSHI to 6.9.0.
- Add additional languages to installer (French, Deutsch, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish).
