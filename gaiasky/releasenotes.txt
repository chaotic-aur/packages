# Gaia Sky 3.6.11

## Features
- Add `transition_fov()` (APIv2) and `fovTransition()` (APIv1) calls to create smooth transitions in camera field of view angle.
- Add `set_label_[in|ex]clude_regexp` calls to filter allowed and/or required label formats. If the include regexp is set, only labels that match it are allowed. If the exclude regexp is set, labels that match it are not allowed.
- Add `set_mute_label()` APIv2 call (`setMuteLabel()` APIv1) to disable the label of individual objects.
- Add `get_fov()` API call to APIv2, and `getFov()` to APIv1 to get the current camera field of view angle.

## Bug Fixes
- Disable render stage of notifications interface when notifications are off instead of just preventing the creation of messages; This is so that the empty table background is not seen when notifications are off.
- Add scroll pane to layout of enabled datasets in welcome window. Add 'disable dataset' shortcut to each dataset.
- Fix overall visual consistency and usability of enabled datasets in welcome window.
- Keep clouds on the dark side of planets marginally visible instead of making them totally disappear during the night.
