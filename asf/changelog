  * 6.1.0.1-1:
    [!] ASF is now based on .NET 9, which opens new V6.1 release family. As usual, generic users will require .NET 9 upgrade, OS-specific users are covered by us in the included runtime. .NET 9 brings a lot of under-the-hood features, bugfixes and other improvements (@JustArchi #3244).
    Redeeming points (rp) now checks points price of target items and refuses to redeem if their cost is non-zero. It's possible to append ! character at the end of definitionID in order to force redeeming even with non-zero cost (@JustArchi #3327).

    Added new bgrclear command (@JustArchi #3294).
    Renamed Experimental update channel to PreRelease. This change affects only update command under the hood (@JustArchi).
    Improved STM trades processing in a way it's no longer possible to accept together-conflicting trade offers (@JustArchi #3291).
    Fixed regression introduced around V6.0.6.1 which caused ASF to sometimes not reconnect the bots after heartbeat failure (@JustArchi).
    ASF now takes into account OnlyAllowRunInCountries extended property, which effectively fixes cards farming process sometimes getting stuck at impossible to play run-locked games. Since this requires cache update, it might take up to a week for old data to get invalidated - you can optionally speed up that process by manually deleting ASF.db, although best if you can just wait it out (@JustArchi).

    UserInterfaceMode bot config property got refactored and received some new properties, the existing configs are entirely compatible with it, but the underlying enum has changed (@JustArchi).
    Core internal ASF mechanisms related with our SteamKit2 library were heavily improved/refactored for new functionalities or enhancements. It should be especially visible for people running higher amount of bots, as the resources utilization should drop significantly in those cases (@JustArchi).

    Improved update procedure for ASF and plugins which should decrease amount of accidental corruptions (@JustArchi #3182 #3156).
    Official Monitoring plugin, as announced in the previous release, is now available for general usage, with dedicated wiki page for more info, such as example grafana dashboard (@JustArchi @Abrynos).
    Official plugins will now allow its updates only to matching ASF version (@JustArchi).
    Removed --process-required command-line argument, it's default ASF behaviour now - ASF no longer shuts down when no bots are running.

  * 6.0.1.24-1:
    Fixed crash when running win-x64 ASF variant on the very old CPUs (@JustArchi #3180).
    Added automatic plugin updates functionality. This feature requires appropriate support at plugin level, and allows plugin authors to issue updates easily through unified ASF mechanisms. Plugin updates are disabled by default, you can control that behaviour with PluginsUpdateMode and PluginsUpdateList global config properties (@JustArchi #3151).
    Added support for ASF downgrade in update command, simply append ! character to the end of update channel (@JustArchi).
    Added updateplugins command, which allows to update plugins manually on demand, similar to update command that updates ASF - also supports ! downgrading. In addition to that, added POST /Api/Plugins/Update for IPC (@JustArchi).
    Added initial support for new Steam families. ASF now extracts family members and gives them FamilySharing access to the bot instance automatically on top of the old family sharing system, which is still being used (@JustArchi #3162).
    Added support for FamilyJoin 2FA confirmation type (@ezhevita #3166).
    Added ArchiSteamFarm.OfficialPlugins.Monitoring. This is the first official ASF plugin that doesn't come bundled with the release. Instead, a zip file is provided in each release for those interested, with an optional capability of automatic updates explained above. The plugin is currently considered experimental and requires more polishing and documentation before becoming useful, but it's already made available for those interested (@Abrynos #3160).
    Improved performance of loading own inventories by moving logic over to Steam network. This also makes some breaking changes for plugin creators (@ezhevita #3155, @Citrinate #3164).
    ASF will now try to flash its console window on Windows when expecting user input (@ezhevita #3158 #2998).
    Added limited support for --minimized command-line switch also for Linux and OS X (@ezhevita #3158 #3159).

  * 6.0.0.3-1:
    [!] ASF V6 comes with modern System.Text.Json replacement of previously used since the very first ASF version, Newtonsoft.Json library. This is core foundation that ASF is based on - while it should be mostly transparent for end-users, it's breaking change for existing ASF plugins, and it also has far bigger scope than usual in terms of ASF codebase, hence V6 major version bump. If you're plugin creator, you can find notes below for technical details in regards to upgrade (@JustArchi #3145 #3061).

  * 5.5.3.4-1:
    Added support for private games. ASF will now detect and skip private games from farming, as per your privacy preferences (@JustArchi #3109).
    Added built-in crash protection. The process will now freeze by default with an error if it detects constant crashing upon each restart (@JustArchi)
    Added slight delay upon receiving new items notification during farming, to fight with potential cache issues - this might help ASF not detecting updated cards remaining right away (@JustArchi).
    Our docker containers now include main ASF binary files in /asf rather than /app. There is no change in usage for the users, since /app is still being used as a working directory through ASF_PATH like before (@JustArchi).
    Slightly improved load-balancing in STD module to avoid excessive work right after login (@JustArchi).
    Slightly improved security against IPCPassword side-channel attempts (@LRFLEW #3142).

ASF will automatically convert your existing bot configs into new format, and if you're using --no-config-migrate then you'll need to migrate manually (@JustArchi).
    Added new SkipUnplayedGames option to FarmingPreferences (@JustArchi #3126).
    Added additional aliases: al for addlicense and ala for addlicense ASF (@JustArchi #3127).
    Fixed failure in using cached access tokens after latest Steam breaking change (@JustArchi #3133).

  * 5.5.0.10-1:
    ❗ ASF is now based on .NET 8 platform. While mostly transparent and compatible for end-users, new .NET major version brings a lot of improvements, enhancements, bugfixes and optimizations. It also opens new ASF version cycle, V5.5, due to potential breaking changes (@JustArchi).
    ❗ ASF no longer uses API keys, previous functionality was rewritten to access tokens instead. This also means that ASF will no longer generate API key on each run, you can revoke existing API keys after update if you'd like to (@JustArchi, #3084).
    💥 .NET 8 dropped support for some obsolete OSes, check out compatibility wiki section for up-to-date requirements. All currently supported OSes should work without any issues. Naturally, people running generic ASF variant will need to update their SDK/runtime to version 8.0 (@JustArchi).
    💥 Dropped support for generic-netf platform. Check relevant issue for more details if you're affected (@JustArchi, #3060).
    💥 Our systemd units got upgraded with latest security enhancements, this requires acceptably recent v247 version or newer, which is the case with all currently supported OSes (@JustArchi).
    ✨ Side effect of API keys removal brings limited support for trading on limited accounts, in particular they can do everything that Steam allows, for example accepting donations. Previously they had completely restricted trading functionality (@JustArchi).
    ✨ Enhanced std command in our STD plugin to std [Bots], the command now allows to submit data to SteamDB in one-time mode even with disabled STD config (@JustArchi).
    ✨ Improved PublicListing announcements logic to decrease amount of traffic and workload, which should be especially visible on bots with huge inventories. This is still a bit experimental at this stage on our side, but seems to work much better (@JustArchi, #3073).
    ✨ Enhanced 2fainit to produce maFile.NEW file that is fully compatible with SDA for import (@JustArchi).
    ✨ Added Steam Winter Sale 2023 to SalesBlacklist (@nolddor, #3098).
    🔧 ASF will now use CurrentCulture as announced Steam client language, which influences e.g. language in e-mails being sent (@JustArchi, #3093).
    🔧 Fixed relative path in ASF_CRYPTKEY_FILE not working when using custom ASF_PATH (@JustArchi).
    🔧 Fixed regression introduced while fixing #3051 that sometimes made console input non-operative (@JustArchi, #3075).
    🔧 Fixed Bosnian language not being recognized out of the box for ASF (@JustArchi).

  * 5.4.13.4-1:
    [!] ASF uses new code for redeeming keys now. While this is mostly transparent for end-users, there is a breaking change in the ASF API RedeemKey() functionality, you may need to recompile your plugins if you're making use of that function. Notable difference is that Steam sends e-mails upon key activations now (@JustArchi #3058).
    Added support for refresh token renewals into new login flow (@JustArchi).
    Added additional chat groups APIs for plugin developers (@tre3p #3069).
    ASF can now detect region-locked games and skip them during idling (@JustArchi #2980).

    [!] PublicListing and MatchActively have been extracted from ASF core to standalone ItemsMatcher plugin. MatchActively feature was rewritten from scratch in regards to Steam breaking changes and is now a paid feature requiring a LicenseID to work. Please check out new ItemsMatcher wiki page for more info (@JustArchi).
    Optimized MatchActively, which is no longer limited by matching unique sets only, surpassing previous round-based system and achieving superior speed in the process (@JustArchi #2784).
    Added LicenseID global config property, it's used exclusively for MatchActively feature for now (@JustArchi).
    Added optional [channel] argument to update command, this allows you to easily update experimental even if you're tracking stable channel (@JustArchi).
    Added match command which can trigger MatchActively routine on as-needed basis (@JustArchi).
    Added FilterBadBots global config property with default value of true, ASF will now refuse trade offers from bots that we classify as harmful towards the community (@JustArchi).

    [!] ASF is now based on .NET 7, a new major version. From notable changes, this version brings a lot of performance improvements for arm64 platform. In regards to compatibility, ASF no longer supports operating systems that reached their EOL, especially Windows 7 and 8.1, as well as Debian 9 (#2745). This change warrants B version bump (@JustArchi).
    Fixed too aggressive security settings for our systemd service (@JustArchi #2739).

    ASF's internal HTML parsing module was rebased on top of new major version. This is pretty big update, and while we thoroughly tested this against regressions, please let us know if you find anything unusual not working as expected (@JustArchi).
    Added workaround against apparently-not-so-rare Steam issue which caused ASF to cache invalid packages data. ASF will now cache Steam packages data for no longer than a week, so removing ASF.db manually should no longer be required in any circumstance (@JustArchi).
    Enhanced addlicense command to recognize Fail/AlreadyPurchased and Fail/RateLimited (subIDs only for the second). ASF will now skip requests to Steam if it determines that it already owns given apps/packages, which makes it possible to supply a huge "activation list", and activate only what's needed from it, without tripping rate limits on Steam side (@JustArchi).

    ASF will no longer accept trades exceeding configured MaxTradeHoldDuration where we're the cause of that (@JustArchi).
    Added addlicence command alias for addlicense to account for non-american wording (@JustArchi #2596).
    Added Steam Summer Sale 2022 with appID of 2021850 to SalesBlacklist (@Abrynos #2621).
    GamesPlayedWhileIdle will now favour last allowed game instead of CustomGamePlayedWhileIdle, if you require custom title (which is not guaranteed anyway), then supply maximum of 31 entries instead (@JustArchi #2599).
    GamesPlayedWhileIdle are now transmitted in order they were specified in the config, which might be wanted e.g. in regards to recently played games on Steam. Previously the order was undefined (@JustArchi ref).
    Fixed possible ASF's logging mechanism corruption (and crash afterwards) caused by failure to start IPC server (@JustArchi ref).
    Fixed ASF without --process-required incorrectly shutting down when editing the config of the only bot whether through ASF API or manually (@JustArchi).
    ASF 2FA code should now generate correct tokens not only until year 2106 like before, but all the way to year 2554 - just in case sunglasses (@JustArchi #2594).
    ASF will no longer restart farming on each license list Steam event, only on those actually granting us new games (@JustArchi).

    ASF suggestions about weak passwords are a bit more specific now in some cases (@JustArchi).
    Changed default value of SkipAutoGrantPackages in SteamTokenDumper plugin from false to true. Using value of false is very situational and usually not wanted for people that are actually affected by this setting, regardless, it's up to user's configuration (@JustArchi #2558).
    Fixed obsolete language codes used by Chinese language by moving them to modern ones: zh-CN -> zh-Hans, zh-TW -> zh-Hant, zh-HK -> zh-Hant-HK. This change should have no effect on automatic language detection or Chinese translations in ASF, but if you're currently using obsolete language tag (such as zh-CN) and your OS is unable to map it correctly to modern tag (such as zh-Hans), consider setting CurrentCulture yourself (@JustArchi).

  * 5.2.3.5-1:
    Added OnlineFlags bot config property (@Deyvan #2511).
    Removed Statistics global config property. Added RemoteCommunication bot config property in its place that allows switching communication with Steam group and ASF STM listing on per-bot basis. Existing users of Statistics: false will be automatically migrated to RemoteConnection: 0. If you've disabled automatic config migration through cmd-line switch, you'll need to migrate yourself, as obsolete property will be removed in the next release cycle (@JustArchi).
    Directly connected with the above, we've added new remote communication wiki section in place of old statistics section, where users can now learn about third-party remote communication included in ASF. We recommend to give it a read if privacy subject is important to you (@JustArchi).
    Added additional delay logic to GamesPlayedWhileIdle if the session was previously forcefully disconnected due to starting a game (@JustArchi).
    MatchActively setting of TradingPreferences no longer requires SteamTradeMatcher to be enabled as well. It's now possible to match cards passively (SteamTradeMatcher), actively (MatchActively), or both. Previously standalone active matching was not possible (@JustArchi).

2022-01-07 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 5.2.1.5-1:
    Plugins breaking: All interface methods now return a Task instead of void, this will require from you slight code changes and a recompilation to work with this release. See my commit for rationale behind this change and more info. This was required to fix a race condition in STD (below), and I wouldn't be surprised if some of your plugins had exactly the same problem, just harder to trigger (@JustArchi).
    Added IUpdateAware plugin interface (@JustArchi).
    Added Steam Winter Sale 2021 with 1797760 identifier to SalesBlacklist (@JustArchi).

  * 5.2.0.10-1:
    I've reverted the breaking change of refusing to run as root, as apparently a lot of Windows setups are configured like that, and I do not really expect from every second user to override it with a cmdline arg. ASF will still display a warning though (@JustArchi).
    Fixed ASF silently ignoring invalid --path argument supplied, it'll now exit with an error if told to navigate to invalid directory (@JustArchi).
  * 5.2.0.9-1:
    [!] ASF V5.2 opens a new major milestone due to significant .NET 6.0 runtime upgrade. .NET runtime upgrade brings a lot of under-the-hood changes, compatibility enhancements, performance improvements, features and bugfixes (@JustArchi @Abrynos #2388).
    Breaking: renamed commands bl, ib and iq (with add and rm) to tb, fb and fq, accordingly. This further helps unifying the terms used across ASF (@JustArchi #2368).
    Breaking: functions previously marked as obsolete exposed to third-party plugins have been removed from ASF as a part of B release cycle (@JustArchi).
    Breaking: ASF will now refuse to run as root user by default. See wiki entry for more details (@JustArchi).
    Breaking: removed password command, use encrypt instead (@JustArchi).
    ASF's internal codebase has changed dramatically in regards to various .NET 6.0 improvements that we've implemented. While those changes should not cause regressions in regards to previous usage, the scope of them is huge enough to warrant a note in the changelog, as it's far more than just "usual amount of core improvements", please let us know if you spot any kind of regressions or other issues that you didn't face with V5.1 versions, and you suspect that they could be related to new runtime (@JustArchi #2446).
    ASF will now validate build checksum against independent remote server prior to automatically updating from GitHub, this improves overall security in case of malicious GitHub takeover (@JustArchi #2452).
    .NET 6.0 allows further performance tweaking, we've updated high-performance-setup on the wiki to reflect that (@JustArchi).
    Added two additional crypto methods for SteamPassword: EnvironmentVariable and File, check out security section for more details (@JustArchi).
    Added osx-arm64 variant of ASF for 64-bit ARM-based (Apple silicon) OS X OSes (@JustArchi).
    It's now possible to use SOCKS proxies as a WebProxy setting in ASF. Simply use socks5:// (or likewise) protocol (NET 6.0 enhancement).
    Added evaluation of ~ character mapped to user's home directory when used in --path. This allows you to use non-evaluated ~ character in --path and ASF_PATH environment variable, also on Windows (@JustArchi).
    Fixed ASF unnecessarily trying to create www directory in its binary location if it didn't exist yet, and crashing when not being able to do so (@JustArchi).

    Added ASF API endpoints for importing and removing ASF 2FA authenticators (@Abrynos #2426).
    Added IPC localization through request headers (@Abrynos #2431 #2435).
    Corrected several aspects of our ArchiSteamFarm@.service file for systemd in regards to initial feedback. We're also happy to say that it's now ready for general usage, see management section for details (@JustArchi).
    ASF will now print a warning if you attempt to run it as an administrator (root). This warning will be corrected to an error in the next B cycle (likely .NET 6.0). See never run as administrator! (@JustArchi).
    We've changed declaration of our docker services to utilize a non-root user for ASF process, rebuilding your containers isn't necessary right away, but will be in the future when we refuse to run as root (@JustArchi).
    Improved !addlicense command which can now reflect a bit better the real result of the license activation attempt (@JustArchi @xPaw).

    Added ArchiSteamFarm@.service service file declarations for systemd to generic, generic-netf and linux variants. Since their exact usage is not documented on the wiki yet, they're in the preview state for the brave sunglasses.
    Added --service command-line argument which forces Headless: true, used mainly for service files mentioned above.

    Fixed regression affecting generic-netf builds introduced in version 5.1.2.0 that broke automatic update capability. Existing generic-netf users are advised to update their ASFs manually to this (or newer) release in order to fix the problem. This bug does not affect any other setups, it's exclusive to generic-netf variant.
  * 5.1.3.8:
    Failed attempt at fixing generic-netf update capability
  * 5.1.3.7:
    Fixed regression that caused excessive delay during program shutdown on Windows machines.
2021-09-02 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 5.1.3.6-1:
    We've reverted our change introduced as part of V5.1.3.2 in which the builds are built on the corresponding OSes due to issue dotnet/msbuild#3897 which caused missing Chinese translation (among some other) on non-Windows builds of ASF. Fortunately, this doesn't affect the chmod +x improvement which stays with us as part of this feature release (ref: #2411).
    We've extracted our .NET Framework compatibility layer to standalone JustArchiNET.Madness library. If you're a plugin developer and using our ArchiSteamFarm.Compatibility namespace for generic-netf, then this is a breaking change for you as you'll need to reference our compatibility library instead. For everybody else, this changes nothing.
    Every release on GitHub now includes two additional files: SHA512SUMS and SHA512SUMS.sign, those can be used for verification purposes as explained in our extended FAQ.
    GitHub assets included in our releases are now built on the corresponding OSes, for increased compatibility and independence. This enhancement also improves flow for our Linux and OS X users, as they no longer need to chmod +x the executable files after extraction (assuming your unpacking tool understands permissions set in the zip file, that is).
    Official ASF assemblies are now private signed. Custom ASF builds are publicly signed instead for the same compatibility factor.
    ASF command-line arguments are now case-insensitive, for increased compatibility and convenience (ead2d46).
    Fixed mabadd and mabrm commands not working correctly, as they were modifying idling blacklist instead (#2390).
    Fixed our STD plugin not being initialized correctly in generic-netf ASF variant (13ea9df).
    Fixed IPC issue that could result in an error when the response was generated as part of ApiAuthenticationMiddleware (#2400).

  * 5.1.2.4-1:
    [!] Fixed ASF incorrectly removing IPCPassword when updating global config as part of POST /Api/ASF ASF API request. We strongly recommend everybody using IPC with remote access to read our security advisory and verify their IPCPassword (#GHSA-wxx4-66c2-vj2v).
    ASF will no longer allow other machines than localhost to access ASF API in IPC interface without IPCPassword set by default, as an extra security measure. You can either set up IPCPassword or override that in IPC.config if absolutely required (#2371).
    ASF plugins can now re-use existing ASF API controllers (#2343).
    Greatly improved logic responsible for fetching owned games, e.g. as part of owns command. Third-party plugins using previous AWH endpoints are advised to update, as we intend to remove the obsolete endpoints in the next version (#2370).
    Further improved our Steam message splitting logic to attempt splitting with more sense if possible (#2348).
    Added SRI and caching support to our IPC interface.
    Our swagger.json schema now includes more information about various limits on bot and global config properties, for optional interpretation by third-parties.
    Fixed GET /Api/NLog ASF API endpoint closing the websocket incorrectly upon Close opcode of 0x8.
    Fixed POST /Api/ASF/Update unnecessarily taking 15 seconds to complete when user was running newer version than latest available on his update channel (#2344).
    Fixed reset command not returning back to GamesPlayedWhileIdle, if specified.
    Fixed ICrossProcessSemaphoreProvider ASF plugins not initialized correctly (#2342).
    Fixed unwanted automatic reload of custom IPC.config when using --no-config-watch.

    Added several /Api/Storage endpoints for third-party usage (#2337).
    Rewritten functionality responsible for sending Steam messages in regards to new rate-limits (#2335, and it wasn't easy clap).
    Improved support for ASF running on FreeBSD operating system.
    Our STD plugin will now refuse to run upon any config parsing error, as an extra safety measure.
    Reduced amount of I/O writes for ASF configs and databases by avoiding I/O write of the same content as that already written.

  * 5.1.0.9-1:
    Fixed advanced config for STD plugin not being parsed correctly.
  * 5.1.0.8-1:
    [!] ASF V5.1, while fairly compatible for the users, has gone through extensive refactor and maintenance internally which was crucial for the future development. We've reorganized the whole project structure, re-evaluated the decisions made in the past and corrected those that were vastly suboptimal given time. All third-party plugins will need to be recompiled in order to work with this release. For plugin developers, we've also prepared a small "developer changelog" below.
    Our SteamTokenDumperPlugin now supports advanced config that might come useful for the developers and other people having access to potentially sensitive apps on Steam. As of today the config includes various exclusion options.
    Upon loading a config file, ASF will now automatically migrate it to the latest syntax, if needed. This covers especially the below config property changes, but also the general cleanup of removing default properties and re-ordering the file to follow ASF scheme. All custom plugin properties (such as our SteamTokenDumperPluginEnabled) are left in-tact.
    Added --no-config-migrate command-line argument for setups that can't or don't want to utilize automatic migration explained above.
    Added points command (#2330).
    IPC is now true by default. The property still exists for people that would like to disable it through "IPC": false.
    IdlePriorityQueueOnly has been renamed to FarmPriorityQueueOnly, other than that it acts the same as before. ASF will automatically migrate this change if config migration is enabled (default behaviour).
    IdleRefundableGames has been renamed to SkipRefundableGames, other than that it acts as a negation now, as it was counter-intuitive (to deactivate) before. ASF will automatically migrate this change if config migration is enabled (default behaviour).
    Fixed AWH retry logic not working properly with Steam Web API calls (SteamRE/SteamKit#992).

    We've added missing localization support for our SteamTokenDumper plugin, it's now consistent with the rest of ASF.
    Our internal HandleTwoFactorAuthenticationConfirmations() function now allows to retrieve handled confirmations for plugins and API usage. Third-party plugins using ASF 2FA might require a recompilation to accomodate this change.
    Fixed a very rare possibility of wrong Steam time getting cached for prolonged amount of time (used in ASF 2FA).

2021-01-07 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 5.0.2.4-1:
    [!] Docker builds are now built by GitHub (previously Docker Hub), available also on ghcr.io (in addition to Docker Hub) and supporting multi-platform manifests. Because of unified manifest, -arm and -arm64 docker tags are no longer being deployed, as they're now included in the main tag. Fixed A.B.C.D-{arch} tags that were released in the past remain available for download. Check out our wiki for more info (#2096).
    Added --no-config-watch command-line argument.
    Added a workaround for IPC not starting in generic-netf variant running under mono.
    ASF will now print Steam error text for failed trade offers, if available (#2116).
    Fixed a possibility of ASF cache not getting invalidated properly, which could result in games being classified as temporarily unavailable to idle. ASF will invalidate existing (old) caches automatically, so there is no need from you to do anything.

2020-11-25 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 5.0.0.5-1:
    [!] ASF V5 opens a new major milestone due to significant .NET 5.0 runtime upgrade. .NET runtime upgrade brings a lot of under-the-hood changes, compatibility enhancements, performance improvements, features and bugfixes.
    Our OS-specific builds make use of the newest trimming mode, link, which further decreases size of the resulting binaries, making OS-specific builds smaller compared to ASF V4.
    Apart from the runtime change, ASF V5 also received a significant code cleanup and refactor (including C# 9), some of those changes affect our public API surface and require third-party V4 plugins to be recompiled. Most significant change includes moving Bot.HasPermission() to Bot.HasAccess(), apart from that it's mostly transparent refactor.
    Starting from ASF V5, we've decided to slightly update our release cycle in order to make released version numbers more significant. The development process remains the same as before.
    Added IPCPasswordFormat global config property and hash command, allowing to hash IPCPassword (#2014).
    Added new functionality through CompleteTypesToSend bot config property (#2004).
    We've slightly changed our console input request to be less annoying (#2048).
    ASF will now refuse to run in unsupported environments by default, we've added --ignore-unsupported-environments command-line argument to override this if you know what you're doing.
    Fixed a possibility of updated token/key not being submitted to SteamDB when using our STD plugin.

    In our NLog SteamTarget, BotName is now of type Layout which offers additional features to those that would appreciate them. Existing setups will continue to work as before.
    IPC custom configuration now supports KnownNetworks property, which can be used for forwarding proxy headers from reverse proxies hosted on different machines than ASF itself (#2003).
    ASF will now log friend invites on Trace logging level, allowing to catch that event for those that would appreciate it (#2005).
    Latest ASF-ui with new features, improvements and bugfixes.

2020-09-21 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 4.3.0.6-1:
    [!] General code refactor for implementing C# 8.0 nullable references. This change might require some third-party plugins to be recompiled, due to misc API changes that had to be applied in the process (#1543).
    [!] ASF now supports specifying custom headers and cookies with a WebBrowser request - this is a breaking API change which might require some third-party plugins to be recompiled with additional code fixes (#1964).
    [!] ASF will no longer retry requests upon receiving 5xx strError response during accepting a trade offer. This change slightly modifies internal API of (...)WithSession() functions, which may require plugin recompilation of third-party plugins (#1832).
    AdditionalProperties field of Steam.Asset has been changed to AdditionalPropertiesReadOnly to allow proper extension deserialization. If you're a plugin developer and using this field, please adapt your usage (#1958).
    ASF will now use a GET request for 301 and 302 redirections (#1963).
    Added encrypt command (#1950).
    Fixed ASF not accepting case-insensitive 2FA codes (regression).
    Fixed a possibility of level command to produce response for unauthorized users (#1957).

  * 4.2.4.0-1:
    Added POST /Api/Bot/{botNames}/TwoFactorAuthentication/Confirmations API endpoint which allows to accept/reject confirmations with more parameters.

They'll be removed in the next ASF version, please update your usage of Confirmations/Accept and Confirmations/Cancel to Confirmations.
2020-07-17 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 4.2.3.6-1:
    [!] Fixed ASF's inability to resolve public inventory status (and therefore SteamTradeMatcher feature) due to latest Steam breaking change (#1866).
    ASF is now capable of resolving 2FA's device_id automatically. This makes it possible for importing maFiles without device_id, as well as authenticators that are entirely missing that info, which wasn't possible previously. ASF will no longer store device_id of the ASF 2FA authenticators, existing ASF 2FA authenticators will drop that property on next bot's database update (no action is needed from you).
    Added AvatarProfileFrame and AnimatedAvatar to recognized community item types (#1871).
    Added GET /Api/Plugins IPC API endpoint.
    Added x-definition to our swagger enum types, flags enum types now display with format: flags in the JSON API definition.
    Added uptime information to stats command.
    Fixed a possibility of running into ASF crash when fetching depot keys as part of STD plugin fails.

  * 4.2.0.1-1:
    [!] ASF V4.2 comes with rewritten implementation responsible for handling HTML documents, which is expected to reduce memory footprint and increase performance when dealing with HTML parsing. While this change is expected to be fully compatible for end users, old ASF plugins utilizing HtmlDocument functions will require appropriate changes (#1703).
    Our docker latest image has been slightly rebuilt to include OS-specific variant of ASF. We recommend you to rebuild your containers if you're using the latest tag in order to avoid potential issues that we've managed to solve, other docker tags (such as released) are not affected (#1720).
    ASF will now prefer to use HTTP/2 for whole web communication, whenever possible.
    Slightly optimized unlocking Steam parental accounts, resulting in less time waiting for it.

2019-02-08 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 4.0.0.5-1:
    [!] ASF now comes with a plugin system, powerful enough to justify opening a new major ASF V4 version. Despite the version bump, there are no breaking changes compared to V3 and all V3 setups will update to V4 without issues.
    ASF is now aware of Steam items rarity, therefore features like SteamTradeMatcher or MatchActively will now take them into account and find matches only across the same rarity. This affects MatchableTypes of Emoticon and ProfileBackground.
    Added SaleItem, Consumable and ProfileModifier Steam item types, which can now be specified e.g. in LootableTypes. This also means that they're no longer Unknown, as per previous ASF releases.
    Added support for certain normally-broken 2FA deviceIDs that were deemed as invalid in the previous release.

  * 3.4.1.7-1:
    [!] Updated .NET Core runtime from 2.1 to 2.2. As usual, generic users are reminded to update their runtimes, OS-specific users are covered by us, no prerequisites changes.
    Further MatchActively improvements:
        The code is now aware of non-tradable items and will properly try to match tradable ones in order to create a matching sum. Previously ASF operated on tradable items exclusively.
        The code is now aware of non-responding bots and upon detection of missed trade, will not attempt to match the bot during remaining rounds.
        The code now properly resumes matching that was cut in the middle while creating another trade offer.
        Various other small logic-related improvements and bugfixes.
    Added Steam winter sale 2018 to built-in blacklist.
    Increased default value of WebLimiterDelay from 200 to 300 due to more harsh Steam restrictions.

2018-11-09 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 3.4.0.7-1:
    [!] Implemented extra logic to session validation code which has a potential to fix various request failures that people have reported recently. This was needed due to Steam change that rendered previous logic partially obsolete.
    Added balance command (ref: #935).
    Misc updates to ASF API, all Bot calls support botNames now, those that didn't before got their response type updated to accomodate this, refer to swagger for more details.
    Misc updates to swagger, the frontend now allows you to use IPCPassword during execution of API calls.
    ASF-ui updates with new features, improvements and bugfixes.
    Usual amount of other code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2018-11-01 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 3.4.0.5-1:
    We've improved our update process according to feedback of users that encountered some problems. If something doesn't work, we recommend to download this release (or newer) manually and copy over config directory. Not a lot of people got affected by this problem, so if everything works for you, you don't need to do anything.
    Fixed restart command that we accidentally made to work the same as exit during our huge kestrel refactor, whoops (ref: #932).
    Synced ASF-ui to latest release which should fix some issues that people have reported.
    Other misc code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2018-10-31 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 3.4.0.4-1:
    [!] We've moved ASF project under JustArchiNET GitHub organization. This change should be mostly transparent for you as old URLs redirect appropriately. Only web config generator is no longer accessible under old URL, we've already updated all references (on wiki and alike). If you're using URL to our repo in your own projects, you might want to update them.
    [!] We've rewritten our IPC interface from HttpListener to KestrelHttpServer (ref: #761).
        Kestrel http server is modern drop-in replacement for legacy and far more basic HttpListener that we've used until now. IPC API and IPC GUI (now ASF-ui) continues to work like before.
        This change has dramatically improved ASF's code maintenance in regards to IPC routines. Our new code is very clean and efficient, allowing further development of IPC with ease.
        Kestrel comes with a lot of under-the-hood improvements in regards to IPC, especially compatibility, stability and performance improvements. Some of them include support for ETag, modern response compression algorithms (such as brotli) or increased compatibility by implementing all modern RFCs.
        We've slightly improved our CORS policy. ASF API now allows cross-origin resource sharing only when IPCPassword is set. See wiki for details.
        It's now possible to use IPC with custom base path (ref: #840).
        It's now possible to run IPC with https natively.
        Removed IPCPrefixes global config property, listening addresses are now handled by Kestrel config directly.
        A lot of other improvements related to performance, compatibility and stability.
    [!] Breaking changes in ASF API:
        Documentation of ASF API has moved to swagger, which apart from delivering that, also includes far easier ASF API access and other benefits. It's now possible to programmatically check exact definition of all ASF API endpoints.
        /Api/Bot/{bot} now returns a name-bot map (previously: array of bots).
        /Api/Bot/{bot} no longer uses SteamID for online status, there is IsConnectedAndLoggedOn for that now.
        /Api/Log has moved under /Api/NLog.
        /Api/GamesToRedeemInBackground/{bot} has moved under /Api/Bot/{bot}/GamesToRedeemInBackground.
        There are other small changes related to error reporting and similar, but nothing that should break existing apps.
        ASF API has gained a lot of new endpoints that are supposed to replace commands in long-run. New /Api/Bot/{bot}/Pause is one of those. Refer to our new swagger doc for details.
    [!] IPC GUI has been replaced by ASF-ui (aka "IPC GUI v2") built on top of new ASF API:
        ASF-ui has become a separate project under ASF. It has its own flow of development - you can post your bug reports, suggestions, pull requests and other questions in that place.
        ASF-ui is still in heavy development, so bugs and fixes are to be expected. Given time, we hope to see a fully-featured web GUI that will fully deprecate the use of commands and improve user experience, perhaps to the point of having its own ASF GUI release.
        ASF comes with latest version of ASF-ui included at the time of release.
        It's now possible to use your own IPC-ui frontend (instead of ASF-ui) by using --path command-line argument and putting www directory inside (ref: #915).
    Added transfer@ and transfer^ commands (ref: #908, #911).
    Default value of SteamProtocols was changed from 5 back to 7 due to fixing issue #882.
    Fixed SteamTradeMatcher logic flaw that could interpret some valid neutral+ trades as bad.
    Fixed IdleRefundableGames value change not taking effect until ASF restart (ref: #912).
    Removed default config files, ASF can now work without ASF.json being present. Full JSON structure is still available on the wiki for those that would prefer to generate configs manually, everybody else overwrites those files anyway. You may want to delete example.json and minimal.json manually from your config directory.
    Removed <Modes> argument from transfer commands, added TransferableTypes bot config property as drop-in replacement.
    [Deprecation] SteamParentalPIN bot config property is now available under SteamParentalCode with one subtle difference - null is now treated as no PIN while 0 as PIN provided during update (In old property it was the other way). We needed this change for ASF-ui. ASF will map old logic during first stage of deprecation.
    Usual amount of other code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2018-09-06 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 3.3.0.6-1:
    Added games cache to owns command in order to speed up consecutive checks. Cache is transparent and automatically invalidated on new licenses added to the account.
    AcceptGifts setting now also handles steam wallet gift cards (ref: #885)
    Temporarily removed UDP protocol from default SteamProtocols due to issue #882.
    Fixed POST /Api/Bot IPC API endpoint with non-default PasswordFormat that could emit wrong SteamPassword field in generated config.
    Fixed ASF still replying to commands when being run with OnlineStatus of 0 due to wrong logic of Steam network.
    IPC GUI bugfixes, new features and other improvements.
    Usual amount of other code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2018-08-12 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 3.3.0.3-1:
  [!] Added support for new Steam chat.
        ASF will now listen to group chat commands only on chat of the SteamMasterClanID chat (and not any chat it was invited to like how it worked before).
        Added MarkReceivedMessagesAsRead to BotBehaviour bot config property.
        Added SteamMessagePrefix global config property.
        Added ChatGroupID to SteamTarget logging target.
        Removed HandleOfflineMessages bot config property and entire offline messages logic (use new invisible OnlineStatus for that).
        Rewritten old chat logging functionality into new LogEventInfo-based chat logging module.
        A lot of other compatibility changes/improvements regarding support of new Steam chat, such as making use of new internal API endpoints, also in private chat.
    Regex pattern r! in ASF commands is now case-sensitive (due to bot names being case sensitive too).
    Added BuildVariant to GET /Api/ASF IPC API call (ref: #860).
    Added GET/DELETE /Api/GamesToRedeemInBackground IPC API call (ref: #856).
    Fixed SteamTradeMatcher logic that could lead to accepting bad trades in specific circumstances (ref: SC).

    ASF commands now support a regex for <Bots> argument (ref: #841).
    Added loot@ command (ref: #826).
    Added two new farming orders: MarketableAscending and MarketableDescending (ref: #832).
    addlicense command will now prefer activating subID over appID in case of a number conflict.
    Improved unpack command in terms Steam networking issues.
    Fixed a race condition in ASF code that could result in BGR process being called several times for the same batch of keys.
    [Deprecation] DismissInventoryNotifications bot config property is now a part of BotBehaviour and not a standalone setting. ASF remains compatible with old behaviour during first stage of deprecation.
    [Deprecation] Removed FarmingOrder bot config property in favour of new FarmingOrders property that supports multiple arguments and fixed order. ASF remains compatible with old behaviour during first stage of deprecation.
    [Deprecation] Features deprecated in previous release have entered stage 2 and got removed.

    Added misc Trace logging info related to receiving donation trades.
    Added a workaround for a very stupid profile redirection issue.
    [Deprecation] IsBotAccount is now splitted into independent BotBehaviour bot config property settings. If you'd like to use old IsBotAccount: true behaviour, use BotBehaviour: 7 instead. ASF will automatically map IsBotAccount: true to BotBehaviour: 7, during first stage of deprecation.
    [Deprecation] Removed --server command-line argument. Use newly-introduced IPC global configuration property instead. ASF will still map --server to IPC: true during first stage of deprecation.
    [Deprecation] Running ASF with IPC enabled no longer implies --process-required command-line argument. If you'd like to follow old behaviour, declare --process-required yourself. ASF will still imply --process-required when --server is used, during first stage of deprecation.
    [Deprecation] Removed --service command-line argument by splitting it into three independent options: --no-restart, --process-required and --system-required. You should declare the ones you need (including all three if you'd like old behaviour). ASF will still map --service to all switches above during first stage of deprecation.

    Added !pause^ command (sticky pause). This is how !pause worked before steam family sharing improvements introduced recently.
    Paused bot config property now works as sticky pause (like previously).
    Improved logging module in various ways - if you're using custom logging config, you might want to check it out. There are many internal improvements, but nothing visible for people using ASF default built-in config.

    Added !ownsall command.
    Improved SendOnFarmingFinished - ASF will now also initiate !loot on receiving new items (when not farming), and trades (always).
    ASF will now !loot foil trading cards only on IsBotAccount accounts.
    Further improved overall network stability by implementing heartbeat functions.
    Fixed ASF not recognizing games with more than 255 card drops remaining as available for farming.
    Fixed ASF not following smart redeeming when first account hits OnCooldown.
    Usual code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
    [ConfigGenerator] Properties are now being categorized for easier modifications.

    Slightly improved internal cd-key validator to be case-insensitive and more precise.
    Slightly improved network throughput on Windows machines.
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

  * 2.1.2.5-1:
    Fixed ASF crash related to being unable to execute WMI queries on machines previously affected by HackIgnoreMachineID.
    Removed old ASF 2FA V2.0 -> V2.1 converter, as stated in previous release.
  * 2.1.2.4:
    [!] Next ASF version will come without ASF 2FA converter capable of converting V2.0 formats into V2.1. If you didn't update your old ASF V2.0 yet, it's wise to do so.
    [!] Implemented new smart and persistent CMs list - ASF will no longer need to ask Steam network for list of CMs at startup, significantly improving startup time. The list is saved in ASF.db.
    [!] ASF logging module has been rewritten and is now based on NLog project. New module supports standard built-in ASF rules, as well as custom NLog configuration, in which you can define your own loggers, targets, rules and formats. Check out Logging section in the wiki to learn more.
    Removed LogToFile global config property, which is now always true unless ASF is running as a service. The file logging is now customizable through NLog and described in Logging section in the wiki.
    Updated internal SteamKit2 ASF library to version 1.8, improving stability and compatibility with Steam network.
    Removed HackIgnoreMachineID global config property. New SK2 version should solve the issue for all affected people that had to keep this property at true previously.
    ASF service is now available as ASF-Service.exe extra binary due to incompatibility with new repacking method. There is also new article on the wiki explaining how to run ASF as a service.
    ASF can now log it's messages also to event log, which is enabled by default when ASF is run as a service. You can override this through custom NLog config if you want to.
    Misc portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-07-08 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>

    Changed repack tool used by ASF (ILRepack -> LibZ) which should hopefully fix remaining AV false-positives.
2016-07-02 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.1.7-1:
    [!] ASF now supports SteamPassword also in encrypted form. Visit configuration for info about new PasswordFormat bot config property, as well as security for further explanation.

    Added !lootall and !password commands.
    ASF can now become installed and run as a Windows service, thanks to @justin-gerhardt

    Fixed rare Steam issue that could lead to ASF crash due to failure to log in, after successfully logging in (yes, you read it right - thanks GabeN).
    Fixed rare ASF issue that could lead to program crash during !redeem command when one or more bots had broken database.
    [ConfigGenerator] Added version check, CG will now ensure that it's running only with compatible version of ASF.
    Massive portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.

  * 2.1.0.7-1:
    Added !api command. More can be found on the wiki.
    Increased default value of LoginLimiterDelay from 7 to 10. It seems to solve some recent more aggressive Steam rate-limiting.
    Fixed incorrect calculation of same-type dupe values which could lead into accepting potentially non-neutral+ trades.
    Misc code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-06-20 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.0.6-1:
    Fixed !2faok confirming only one confirmation at a time (2.1.0.5 regression)
    Divided !pause command into !pause and !resume
2016-06-20 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.1.0.5-1:
    [!] Incompatibility with previous versions of ASF - Bot's database will be converted from old V1 into new V2 format, which means that newly generated Bot's database will not run correctly with previous versions of ASF.
    [!] Removed support for linking new authenticator and delinking existing ones, effectively removing UseAsfAsMobileAuthenticator Bot config property and !2faoff command.
    Added support for SteamParental in 2FA sessions. New ASF 2FA uses existing ASF mechanism of SteamParentalPIN to unlock and operate on such accounts, no action is needed.
    Improved security of ASF 2FA - 2FA module will now only accept confirmations ASF directly creates, and not all of them. !2faok command is not affected and still accepts everything.
    Many internal optimizations, bugfixes, improvements and general code review of ASF 2FA.
    [!] Fixed a Steam issue that could lead to ASF not detecting that all cards were dropped already.
    ASF will now state current status of card drops (aka "X card drops remaining") when farming in solo mode.

  * 2.0.5.0-1:
    [!] Greatly improved primary accounts support and removed AccountPlayingDelay global config property.
    ASF will now ignore initial OnFarmingFinished() event when ShutdownOnFarmingFinished is set, and you've just !started this bot instance, allowing you to issue commands without much hassle. Every next event (including the one fired after IdleFarmingPeriod) will be honored.
    !update command will now ignore (override) AutoUpdates setting, allowing you to force ASF update while still being able to skip automatic ones (on program startup and every 24 hours).
    Fixed valid trades potentially being ignored in SteamTradeMatcher when user was overpaying with cards from the same game.
    Fixed wrong dupes calculation when Steam is talking crap and responding with NULL instanceID of items (thanks GabeN).
    Fixed ASF accidentally dismissing notifications related to profile comments.
    Massive portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
2016-05-12 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
  * 2.0.4.4-1:
    ASF now allows only one trade to be sent in SendOnFarmingFinished when account did not farm anything - this cuts spam related to sending trade every IdleFarmingPeriod, while still sending initial trade after connect.
    ASF now allows overpaying when SteamTradeMatcher is enabled.
    ASF no longer replies to given bot commands when bot instance could not be found and user is not SteamOwnerID.
    Slightly improved logic of selecting optimal Steam CM server to minimize network latency and improve network communication.
    Fixed ASF crash when trying to add new ASF 2FA authenticator with null SteamPassword.
    Minor code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.4.1-1:
    ASF 2FA is now more resistant to steam quirks by implementing the same logic of try-retry as usual requests.
    Enhanced !status command which now also shows when bot is running in manual mode (such as !pause or !play).
    Enhanced !owns command which is now able to work also with private profiles, as long as you use SteamApiKey for given account.
    [ConfigGenerator] Graphical config generator now uses asterisks for hiding SteamPassword property.
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.4.0-1:
    Added new bot config property called SteamTradeMatcher with default value of false. As always, you can find more information in the wiki.
    Improved keys-detecting algorithm, which should greatly decrease amount of false-positives causing bot to redeem invalid cd-keys.
    Improved logic of !loot. ASF will now loot only trading cards (including foils) and boosters, instead of all steam community items (such as emoticons or backgrounds).
    When SendOnFarmingFinished is enabled, ASF will now also send trades when bot has nothing to farm.
    Code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.3.4-1:
    Slightly modified logic of DistributeKeys, according to #199
    Added new global config property called AutoRestart with default value of true. As always, you can find more information in the wiki.
    Minor code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.3.3-1:
    Fixed bot not respecting !stop command when initiated during AccountPlayingDelay or InvalidPassword waiting period.
    Fixed very rare bug which could lead to infinite loop (and 100% CPU usage) when bot would get disconnected from steam shortly after we told him to !redeem key and DistributeKeys was disabled (so that bot instance would try to redeem key in infinite loop).
  * 2.0.3.2-1:
    Removed experimental GUI app until it's ready to ship. I don't need people reporting issues for non-finished program.
    Small amount of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.3.1-1:
    [!] ASF Config Generator is now named ASF-ConfigGenerator.exe.
    [!] Added new, experimental GUI wrapper for ASF, which is named ASF-GUI.exe. Majority of the work has been done by @KlappPc, which made it possible. You're free to give it a try, but please keep in mind that it's not yet stable.
    Added Headless ASF config property. Check wiki for more info.
    Added proper support for handling very long steam responses (over 2048 characters). Bot will now split those messages and send in parts.
    Enhanced !owns command, it now accepts multiple appIDs and gameNames, you can also use mixed queries containing both. Visit wiki for more info.
    Fixed ASF not triggering shutdown with ShutdownOnFarmingFinished when account didn't have any games to farm right after starting.
    Fixed a very rare crash that could happen when refreshing a steam session.
    Fixed rare problem related to removing old binary after auto update.
    [ConfigGenerator] Fixed config save not being triggered when editing collections (such as GamesPlayedWhileIdle).
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
    ASF now features rewritten internal WebBrowser based on latest ArchiBoT changes. New WebBrowser includes e.g. native support for automatic compression/decompression of web traffic, which greatly helps reading very long steam badge pages.
  * 2.0.2.4-1:
    Bots can now redeem multiple keys also via !redeem command. Visit wiki for more info.
    Added !2fano command, visit wiki for more info.
    Fixed misc bug related to redeeming of keys on offline bot instances.
  * 2.0.2.3-1:
    [!] ASF no longer includes support for converting old V1.0 XML bot configs into new V2.0 JSON format. If you still need to perform a conversion, then you should do that with previous stable ASF V2.0.1.9, or start making configs from scratch.
    ASF can now accept and redeem steam gifts, through new AcceptGifts bot config property. Visit wiki for more info.
    ASF now logs time spent on farming given appID in human-readable (hh-1:mm) form. You can use that info for deciding whether your account requires CardDropsRestricted.
    Added !help and !pause commands, visit wiki for more info.
    Greatly improved handling of session refreshes for primary accounts. ASF no longer requires a restart of steam client to handle session refresh (which also does not require interrupting of farming)
    Fixed very rare ASF crash caused by malformed bot databases.
    Fixed !exit and !restart commands throwing exceptions when executed via WCF.
    Major portion of code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes.
  * 2.0.1.9-1:
    [!] ASF now comes with graphical config generator - ASF-GUI.exe, which can be used for generating and managing ASF configs. The app also offers tutorial for new users, which should make ASF more user-friendly. Using the GUI app is totally optional and ASF does not require it in order to run properly.
    [!] ASF will now refuse to load standard example.json and minimal.json config files. You're supposed to make a copy of those files, not edit them. ASF Config Generator will also hide and ignore those files by default.
    Greatly improved efficiency of Complex algorithm by reading hours data directly from fetched badge pages (instead of checking every app page)
    AccountPlayingDelay can now be set to value of 0 which will shutdown bot instance when account is being used for playing elsewhere.
    WCFHostname can now be set to value of null, which will make ASF to ask you about the hostname on each startup.
    ASF will now automatically fix non-valid values, such as setting WCFPort to 0.
    Fixed !farm command being able to execute also on non-connected bot instances, it will now fail when given bot instance is not connected.
    Fixed ASF not exiting itself when done executing a command in WCF client mode.
    Fixed rare issue which made it possible for CardsFarmer module to restart already stopped bot instance
    Fixed !farm command not returning Done! output, which was especially problematic when used in WCF
    Debug mode now logs extra info about failed requests.
    Several code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes
  * 2.0.1.5-1:
    Added support for importing WinAuth to ASF 2FA. Check wiki for more info
    Added ForceHttp, LogToFile, SteamProtocol and SteamOwnerID global config properties. Check wiki for more info
    Increased default value of HttpTimeout from 30 to 60. If you need that change in your old ASF.json config, you'll need to do it yourself (ASF never edits configs)
    Added HackIgnoreMachineID global config property, which solves ASF being stuck after connecting to steam for some people. Check wiki for more info
    Improved ASF 2FA security - AcceptConfirmations() ASF 2FA requests executed by trading functions now accept only trading confirmations. !2faok and SendTradePeriod are still accepting all of them
    Added !owns command. Check wiki for more info
    Debug global config property in addition to debugging network traffic, also debugs SK2 module now.
    Fixed rare issue with ASF not disconnecting an account when asked to Stop()
    ASF logger now catches also unobserved (deep) exceptions, which should make debugging easier
    Several code improvements, optimizations and bugfixes. Logging in is much faster now
